## My process
  Created two flexboxes each for the rating form and thank you form.
  No handling of blank submission. Thank You form will still show up. 
  Handled Selection/Deselection of ratings.
  The button event is only to control the form display change.
  Handled only mobile 375px and desktop 1440px breakpoints.
  
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
