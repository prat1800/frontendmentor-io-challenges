## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JQuery

### What I learned

This seemed like the perfect project to exercise JQuery concepts as a beginner. Manipulating DOM esp. the bar chart was a challenge, but realized JQuery or any other JS library just maked it easier to play with DOM elements and dynamically add/remove them. I chose to employe css hover actions instead of JQuery event handlers for the hover changes. 

### Useful resources

- For learning JQuery I used the book "Learning JQuery - Fourth Edition" extensively
